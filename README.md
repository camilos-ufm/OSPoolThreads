matrix multiplication using a thread pool to multiprocess the arithmetic operations

<sub>Vist <a href="#">Troubleshooting</a> to find more.</sub>

## Solution

- Read the CSV files and convert them into matrix.
- A csv_manager was implemented (read and write files with static methods).
- We created a class to implement the solution, it is called mat_mult.py
- This class has several methods that help with the implementation: verify the dimention of the matrix, run the actual code and managing the atributes.
- We used a time package from the python library to keep track of the total amount used for the algorithm.
- The class mat mult has a main method: run() and it implements a list o threads (pool), in which we store each pool.
- We created different partitions of the matrix according to the pool size.
- A part of the matrix is assigned to each thread for it to operate it.
- At the end, we iterate in the list of threads and join them all to the main thread.
- All operations are storaged in an atribute in the class instance, so we print it into a csv.

Final time result for a 500x500 operation: 362.452 seconds

**üí° Warning:** It can take some time and % of the CPU.

## Requirements

To work correctly, you will first need:

- [`Python`](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-394/) must be installed.

Then run this command in order to install all the aditional dependencies from pip

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Installing and running the app

Now that the requirements are satisfied, you can install and run the Mat Mult. First download or clone the repository and:

### [Production]

```
python main.py m1A.csv m1B.csv 4 output.csv

```

Done. This command should run the code.
